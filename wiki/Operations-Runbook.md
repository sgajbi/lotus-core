# Operations Runbook

## Main operational surfaces

- app-local compose runtime
- migration-runner and kafka-topic-creator startup prerequisites
- replay and ingestion-health contracts
- support and lineage APIs
- reconciliation runs
- demo data pack loading

## Useful commands

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs --tail=200 demo_data_loader
docker compose logs --tail=200 migration-runner
docker compose logs --tail=200 kafka-topic-creator
make test-docker-smoke
```

## Preferred diagnostics

Use APIs before going directly to the database where possible:

- support overview:
  `GET /support/portfolios/{portfolio_id}/overview`
- lineage routes:
  `GET /lineage/portfolios/{portfolio_id}/keys`
- replay and ingestion-health routes
- reconciliation run inspection

## Startup checks

When app-local runtime is unhealthy, check this order:

1. `docker compose ps`
2. `migration-runner` completed successfully
3. `kafka-topic-creator` completed successfully
4. service health routes are responding
5. demo data loader completed if the scenario expects seeded data

## Database-first diagnostics

Prefer API diagnostics first, but go to the database when:

- service rollout has not caught up with support telemetry changes
- migration state is in doubt
- you need durable truth for queue or materialization state

For schema state:

```bash
python -m alembic current
```

## Operational boundary

Treat these as `lotus-core` issues:

- ingestion, persistence, replay, and DLQ behavior
- position, valuation, and timeseries materialization
- support, lineage, and reconciliation evidence
- app-local schema or topic bring-up

Treat these as `lotus-platform` issues:

- shared ingress
- cross-repo environment wiring
- platform-owned runtime automation
- ecosystem-level validation governance

## Important rule

When shared infrastructure ownership is the issue, move to `lotus-platform`. When the issue is core
domain truth, replay, persistence, or supportability behavior, stay in `lotus-core`.
